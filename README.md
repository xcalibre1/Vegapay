## Used Module

1. Matarial UI : To use styled HTML elements as Material-UI is the best choice for React because 
                 it is a complete library that offers various components. It is also very easy to use and customize with properly documented.
2. Axios: 
    reason to use: It has good defaults to work with JSON data. Unlike alternatives such as the Fetch API, 
                   you often don't need to set your headers. Or performtedious tasks like converting your request body to a JSON string.
                   Axios has function names that match any HTTP methods. To perform a GET request, you use the .get() method.
                   Axios does more with less code. Unlike the Fetch API, you only need one .then() callback to access your requested JSON data.
